## Overview

Bern AI in RadioTherapy (BART) is a one-day meeting on the 14th of March 2025, aiming to bring researchers together in the radiation oncology, medical physics and the AI engineering community. Our hope and objective is to attempt to update ourselves in the current state of the art and discuss upcoming trends breakthroughs in this field, so we foster better interaction with each other. 

This is an in-person event, with an emphasis on accessibility to early-career researchers and folks who are new to this and interested to get involved in this field. To facilitate this, we had a series of invited talks from all three major stakeholders: industry, academia, and clinics, to give an overview of recent advances, challenges, and efforts for sharing insights.

## Call for Abstracts

We are pleased to announce the **Bern AI in Radiotherapy Symposium** and invite researchers, clinicians, and students to submit their abstracts. This symposium aims to explore and discuss the latest advancements and challenges in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) in radiotherapy. We welcome abstracts related to, but not limited to, AI-driven treatment planning, automated organ segmentation, predictive modeling, image-guided radiotherapy, and patient-specific quality assurance. 

The abstract should provide a concise summary of your research, including the purpose of the study, the methodology used, the key findings, and the significance of the results. This is a great opportunity to share your work with a diverse audience, gain valuable feedback, and network with experts in the field. We look forward to your contributions to this exciting event! Submission deadline and CMT link TBD.

## Motivation

The **Bern AI in Radiotherapy Symposium** aims to foster a collaborative environment that bridges the gap between technology and healthcare. We believe that artificial intelligence holds immense potential in revolutionizing radiotherapy, making treatments more precise, personalized, and efficient. By bringing together researchers, clinicians, and students from around the globe, we aim to facilitate the exchange of innovative ideas, latest research findings, and practical challenges faced in the integration of AI in radiotherapy. This symposium serves as a platform for inspiring discussions, fostering partnerships, and accelerating the advancement of AI applications in radiotherapy. Our ultimate goal is to contribute to the betterment of patient care and outcomes in radiotherapy through the power of AI. We are excited about the possibilities and look forward to the breakthroughs this symposium will undoubtedly catalyze.
