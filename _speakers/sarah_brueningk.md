Prof. Brueningk is an incoming Assistant Professor at University of Bern. Her research focuses on the interface of biology, medicine, mathematical modeling, and data science to provide personalized predictions for healthcare applications based on a variety of input data types. She has a particular interest in data-driven models for rare conditions where data is limited but the impact a prediction model could make in clinical application is particularly high. Specifically, she investigates personalized therapy regimes for pediatric brain tumor patients, including low and high-grade glioma with an emphasis on pediatric diffuse midline glioma. By using tailored input data types and a combination with mechanistic mathematical modeling she devises prediction pipelines that aim for an application as in silicon trial simulation platforms. In this context she investigates generative AI models for anatomical predictions of tumor growth on magnetic resonance imaging, radiotherapy response prediction based on imaging and multi-omics inputs, as well as biomarker identification from histology and magnetic resonance data. Apart from pediatric oncology, she is also involved in data-driven predictions to describe recovery from traumatic spinal cord injury and to detect critical conditions in pediatric intensive care units, such as sepsis.
