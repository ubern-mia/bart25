Prof. Brueningk is an incoming Assistant Professor at University of Bern. Previously, she worked at the interface of computational biology, machine learning and oncology in the MLCB lab of Prof. K. Borgwardt at ETH Zurich. Her expertise in both, practical biological lab work and computational implementations sets her apart from other computational biologists. This experience and her motivation to further scientific progress enables her to pursue challenging projects where multidisciplinary work is key.

Her current projects span a range of topics including the prediction of Alzheimerâ€™s disease using deep convolutional neural networks, the modelling of the Sars-CoV-2 epidemic in the city of Basel, and the simultion of intermittent treatments for recurrent high grade glioma patients.
