Mark completed a DPhil in Medical Image Analysis at University of Oxford in 2004. Subsequently he held academic post-doctoral research positions in both academia and the NHS, largely focused around women’s health. In 2009, he joined Mirada Medical Ltd, motivated by a desire to see technical innovation translated into clinical practice. He has worked on a broad spectrum of clinical applications, developing algorithms for both diagnostic and therapeutic purposes, and in a broad variety of roles. As Chief Scientific Officer at Mirada, Mark led the team that developed the first deep-learning based autocontouring software for radiation oncology that was cleared for clinical use.
Mark’s “happy place” when at work is somewhere between academia and industry (technology readiness levels 3-8). He loves researching solutions to challenging problems, but is passionate about getting those solutions to the clinical end-user. He founded Inpictura to offer his skills more broadly, to foster collaboration between industry, academia and the clinic.
