As a kid I loved sci-fi and still do. Programs like Star Trek (boldly) contained an exciting vision of what the future could hold. While we're not travelling fast than the speed of light to distant planets, some of the ideas have become reality. For example, our mobile phones aren't far removed for the "communicators" envisioned in the 60's, and AI has enabled close equivalents to the "universal translator". AI is really very cool, and amazing things are being done with it in radiotherapy. However, quite often the applications look like little steps towards a greater promise. In this talk I will speculate about an ambitious vision for where AI could take us in delivering radiotherapy. These will be ideas you're not likely to see in a clinic next year but perhaps offer a concept of what the field could look like in 10 or 20 years. Given my lack of ability to time-travel, there's a good chance I will be completely wrong! However, having a vision of where we could go can inspire us to push the limits of what we can do now.
