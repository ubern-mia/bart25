# Call for  Abstracts

Acceptance and selection of orals and posters will be based on how well it matches the theme of the symposium and decisions will be made by the organizers. We will have a light peer-review with an objective score, however, written review feedback cannot be shared.

## Submission

Abstract submissions are due February 1st, AoE. Please email ([Amith](/bart25/speakers/amith_kamath), [Robert](/bart25/speakers/robert_poel), [Dr. Brueningk](/bart25/speakers/sarah_brueningk) and [Dr. Mauricio Reyes](/bart25/speakers/mauricio_reyes)) with your submissions.

Authors will be notified by mid-February about acceptance/rejection. 

## Format

Abstracts are strictly one page long (a second page may only contain the references) and we recommend using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/bart25). Abstracts must be submitted in PDF format, and the review will be single-blind. We expect a brief description of the work including context, methodology and (potentially preliminary) results.

## Presentation Format

Authors of accepted abstracts will be notified by the 15th of February of the presentation format.
