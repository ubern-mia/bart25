# Call for  Abstracts

We welcome your short 500 word + one figure abstracts, which should provide a concise summary of your research, including the purpose of the study, the methodology used, the key findings, and the significance of the results. This is a great opportunity to share your work with a diverse audience, gain valuable feedback, and network with experts in the field. We look forward to your contributions to this event!

Acceptance and selection will be based on how well it matches the theme of the symposium and decisions will be made by the organizers. We will have a light peer-review with an objective score, however, written review feedback cannot be shared.

## Submission

Abstract submissions are due February 1st, AoE. Please email ([Amith](/bart25/speakers/amith_kamath): amith.kamath at(replace with @) unibe.ch and [Robert](/bart25/speakers/robert_poel): robert.poel at(replace with @) insel.ch) with your submissions. Authors will be notified by 15th February about acceptance/rejection. 

Furthermore, authors of accepted abstracts will be notified on the 15th of February about the presentation format. We are likely to request short presentations/talks for a select set of abstracts. Stay tuned here for more.

## Format

Abstracts are strictly one page long (with a maximum of 500 words and one figure) and we recommend using [this template](https://www.overleaf.com/latex/templates/template-bart25/zjpccngwqvfq). Abstracts must be submitted in PDF format, and the review will be single-blind. We expect a brief description of the work including context, methodology and (potentially preliminary) results.

## Travel grants for students and Poster Awards

We have two poster awards, and also have limited travel grants available, mainly for students who cannot otherwise get funding support for traveling to Bern. Please indicate in your submission email about the need for this support. We will only be able to support a small number of travel grant applications, and will process your requests on a first-come-first-serve basis!
